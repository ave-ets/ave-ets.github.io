# AVE Experimental Technology and Standards (ETS) Workstream

The [Atlas of Variant Effects (AVE) Alliance](https://www.varianteffect.org) aims to propel systematic and extensive measurement and analysis of the impact of genetic variants on functional elements of human, model organism and pathogen genomes, to further the understanding of genes, gene products and their regulation and empower the diagnosis and treatment of human disease.

The Experimental Technology and Standards (ETS) workstream facilitates the development, scaling, evaluation, comparison and dissemination of new MAVE methods. Members of this group:

* Develop measures by which to evaluate experimental methods, e.g., what information should go on a ‘report card’ for a mutagenized library, a transfection step, a flow-sorting experiment.
* Develop an information resource for alternative technologies with protocols, tips, caveats.
* Design physical standards (mutagenized libraries, barcode libraries, gRNA pools) that can enable controlled comparison of other tech steps, and strategies for sharing physical standards across groups.

All members are expected to follow the [AVE Code of Conduct](https://www.varianteffect.org/code-of-conduct).
